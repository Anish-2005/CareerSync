# CareerSync

This repository contains a prototype landing page and demo UI for CareerSync — an online job application tracking system. The landing page includes modern UI, Framer Motion animations and a small Three.js scene for an interactive visual.

What I implemented in this pass:
- Landing page components: `Navbar`, `Hero`, `Features`, `DemoDashboard`, and `ThreeScene` (3D).
- Framer Motion for micro-interactions and transitions.
- Lucide icons for crisp vector icons.

Getting started
1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes and next steps
- This is an early UI prototype. Next steps: add persistent storage (local or backend), authentication, drag-and-drop Kanban interactions, accessibility polishing, and unit/visual tests.

If you want, I can start the dev server here and iterate on any part of the UI.
